For the first sentence: "902It is shown how some basic probability tools may help in the characterization of the turbulent processes involved in the mechanics of sediment transport. Both the initiation of sediment motion and the threshold for sediment suspension are analyzed in a stochastic frame of work. Isorisk curves are constructed based upon some minimum experimental information. The well-known Shields' curve is shown to correspond to an erosion risk of approximately 40%. These concepts are believed to be of importance for the design of movable-bed channels as well as for future experimental investigations, which are indeed necessary for computing the risk for higher values of the particle Reynolds number. Finally, an approximate methodology is proposed for computing the risk of erosion."

For the first sentence: "1341This paper proposes a stochastic approach to model temperature dynamic and study related risk measures. The dynamic of temperatures can be modelled by a mean-reverting process such as an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck one. In this study, we estimate the parameters of this process thanks to daily observed suprema of temperatures, which are the only data gathered by some weather stations. The expression of the cumulative distribution function of the supremum is obtained thanks to the law of the hitting time. The parameters are estimated by a least square method quantiles based on this function. Theoretical results, including mixing property and consistency of model parameters estimation, are provided. The parameters estimation is assessed on simulated data and performed on real ones. Numerical illustrations are given for both data."

  Based on the given sentence, I have identified the following risks and their types:
Risks:
Risk Type 1: Uncertainty in Demand
The demand on the system is dependent on the inflow characteristics, aggregate gradation, drainage characteristics of unsaturated soils, and geometry of the pavement section. However, determining the exact demand and capacity of the system is a complex and stochastic process, making it difficult to accurately predict the demand and capacity of the system.
Risk Type 2: Inadequate Capacity
The design of the system is examined in terms of capacity-demand models, and a rational design methodology considering variations in demand through rainfall characteristics and capacity in the form of permeability of the permeable layer is presented. However, the design of the system may not be able to accommodate the actual demand and capacity requirements, leading to inadequate performance.
Risk Type 3: Failure to Account for Uncertainty
The performance measure is analyzed by considering the sensitivity of the design to different variables. However, the evaluation of the system's performance may not take into account the uncertainty associated with the variables  144
