Hi doctor  

risk_abstract.txt is put together with my_llama.ipynb into the same folder  

which contains the first 100K paper abstract related to "risk" category. I already modified the loading path, so as long as you put them in the same folder everything should be fine.  

PS: Llama_generation.txt involves ten results generated by LLama2. You can check on it.
